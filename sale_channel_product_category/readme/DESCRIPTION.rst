Define categories on a sale channel.

The basic use case is to dedicate one category tree per sale
channel.

If you need to exclude some levels, then you have to create a new dedicated tree
of categories or use another module.

It's also possible to share the same tree for different channels.

This module is a dependency of sale_channel_search_engine_category
